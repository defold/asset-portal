This includes sending events and adding socket event listeners.\n- Removed message creation functions in favor of including all message arguments in the functions sending the messages.\n- Added message functions to the client and socket instances. Compare `nakama.do_foo(client, ...)` and `client.do_foo(...)`. The old approach of passing the client or socket instance as the first argument still exists to help with backwards compatibility.",
