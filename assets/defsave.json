      "message": "Patch Notes:\n\n- Replaced JSON-based data serialization with sys.serialize and sys.deserialize functions for improved reliability and performance.\n- Added defsave_ext module with encode_base64 and decode_base64 functions to convert between byte buffers and base64 strings.\n- Introduced defsave.use_serialize variable to enable the new serialization method.\n\nBenefits:\n- Avoids issues with JSON encoding creating null userdata for sparse array elements.\n- Eliminates the \"Cannot serialise table: excessively sparse array\" error when using highly sparse arrays.\n- Provides a more efficient and robust approach to data serialization and deserialization.\n\nTo use the new serialization method, set defsave.use_serialize to true.\n\nThanks @KorolevSoftware !",
