Now the walker collision group is detected automatically, the world collision group is provided with `collision_mask` message to support multiple masks.\n- Added the `collision_mask` message to notify the walker about the collision mask with array of collision groups.\n- Added the `eyes_switching` toggle.\n- Renamed the `eyes_position_url` to `eyes`.\n- Changed a default value of `is_crouching_allowed` to `false`.",
