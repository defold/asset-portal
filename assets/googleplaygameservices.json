The only account that is used is the Google Play Games account on the device.\n* The game.project setting `gpgs.client_id` should be the OAuth2 client id for web application. The client id is used for retrieving server auth token during login flow\n* Fixed type `fomatted_value` -> `formatted_value` in event's information\n* The game.project setting for Android minimum SDK version should be >= 21",
