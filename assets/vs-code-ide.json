Useful to create a script file with ready to use `self` annotations. By default, the class is named by filename.\n\n### Note\n\n- The definition of the `on_input.action` class exists in the updated [defold-annotations](https://github.com/astrochili/defold-annotations/releases) release. So to make `on_input.action` available, please sync [Defold API annotations](https://github.com/astrochili/vscode-defold?tab=readme-ov-file#annotations-syncing) via command pallete.\n\nExample of output with the `script` snippet in the `player.script` file:\n\n```lua\n---@class player.script\n\n---@package\n---@param self player.script\nfunction init(self)\n  \nend\n\n---@package\n---@param self player.script\n---@param dt number\nfunction update(self, dt)\n  \nend\n\n---@package\n---@param self player.script\n---@param message_id hash\n---@param message table\n---@param sender hash\nfunction on_message(self, message_id, message, sender)\n  \nend\n\n---@package\n---@param self player.script\n---@param action_id hash\n---@param action on_input.action\n---@return boolean|nil\nfunction on_input(self, action_id, action)\n  \nend\n\n---@package\n---@param self player.script\nfunction final(self)\n  \nend\n```",
