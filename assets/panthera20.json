Animation Key, select the template and select the animation in the list from `Play Animation` dropdown\n\t- While using Lua format, all template animations will be explicity required in project file\n\t\t- It means you can get build-time errors if any of animation is not exists\n- Add `Animation Project Info Preview`\n\t- When selection animation project at Home tab, the animation information will be shown in the preview panel on the right\n\t- Contains information:\n\t\t- Animation list with Duration\n\t\t- Used nodes and their properties\n\t\t- Used event ids\n\t\t- Used

various path for the `Inspector` project\n\t- You able to customize the default easings for the new created Timeline Keys\n- Add `Select Nodes by Keys` feature\n\t- Currently this option placed in right-button settings menu\n\t- When option is enabled, on selection timeline keys all relative nodes will be selected\n\t- It raise the comfort with nodes while operating only with timeline keys\n-

will be applied to all animations in this project\n\t- Create a `panthera_editor_config.json` file in the project root to customize the editor settings\n\t- You can set another path in `game.project` file in `panthera.panthera_editor_config` field\n- Update for new Defold\n- Font Size can be changed at runtime without reloading\n- Various Fixes in Defold collections exports\n- Fixes with atlas with luminance image type\n\n`panthera_editor_config.json` example:\n```json\n{\n\t\"timeline_key_numbers\": false,\n\t\"custom_event_ids\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"event_id\": \"my_event\",\n\t\t\t\"default_data\": \"icon_id\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"event_id\": \"my_event_2\",\n\t\t\t\"default_data\": \"username\"\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\t\"timeline_colors\": {\n\t\t\"position_x\": \"#EB6262\",\n\t\t\"position_y\": \"#55CC6F\",\n\t\t\"position_z\": \"#80C0E3\"\n\t},\n\t\"font_size\": 40\n}\n```\n\n\n## Changelog Runtime\n\n- Add support for `Shadow` and `Outline` properties for
