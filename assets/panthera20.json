Page\n\nhttps://github.com/Insality/panthera/blob/prerelease/docs_editor/getting_started.md\n\n## Hotfixes\n**v1114**\nFix for Linux/Windows loading issues\nAdd Linux ARM build\n\n**v1120**\nFix for atlas and luminance images issue\nFont size now can be changed in runtime\n\n## Dependencies\n\n`https://github.com/Insality/panthera/archive/refs/tags/runtime.5.zip`\n`https://github.com/Insality/defold-tweener/archive/refs/tags/5.zip`\n\n\n## Changelog Editor\n\nPanthera 2.0 Editor Release Upcoming\n\n\nChangelog\n- Add `Template Animations`\n\t- Currently, it automatically search for the `{GUI_NAME}_panthera.lua` file nearby with binded GUI or Collection file.\n\t- If animation exists, you able to select and play template animations from this file\n\t- If not, you can double click on template node to create a new animation file for this template\n\t- To add Animation Key, select the template and select the animation in the list from `Play Animation` dropdown\n\t- While using Lua format, all template animations will be explicity required in project file\n\t\t- It means you can get build-time errors if any of animation is not exists\n- Add `Animation Project Info Preview`\n\t- When selection animation project at Home tab, the animation information will be shown in the preview panel on the right\n\t- Contains information:\n\t\t- Animation list with Duration\n\t\t- Used nodes and their properties\n\t\t- Used event ids\n\t\t- Used template animations in\n- Add `Filter Nodes panel`\n\t- You able to search nodes by names\n\t- You able to exclude nodes by add `!` prefix, example: `!text`\n\t- You able to group them with space, like `enemy_prefab !root`\n- Fix Windows issues\n\t- The several issues with the paths on Windows was fixed, the editor should work better on Windows now\n- Better Copy-Paste for timeline keys logic\n\t- Several fixes about how timeline keys should be copied to and more correct keys distribution in various cases\n- Add support for the Defold Atlas pivot points feature\n- Max supported atlas size is now `8192x8192` (increased from `4096x4096`)\n- Template transform now applies to all root nodes instead of using template transform\n\t- Now the animation of root properties will be more correct, since template nodes inherit tempalte transform in runtime\n- Add `Show at Desktop` right click menu for all template nodes in Nodes List View\n- Add `Fold/Unfold Nodes` button in Animation Mode\n- Add `Inspector` for Defold/Lua Project\n\t- You able to open Defold project as a folder or ready `json` LLS export file\n\t- The LLS should be installed, the path can be customized in Panthera Editor Settings\n\t- This Inspector allows easily inspect all Lua annotations in one place\n\t- You able to open you code editor at the place where class or function is defined\n\t- You able to adjust your code editor settings in Panthera Editor Settings\n\t- Probably open `folder` only works on MacOS with LLS installed in the system\n- Add `Panthera Editor Settings`\n\t- You able to custom an various path for the `Inspector` project\n\t- You able to customize the default easings for the new created Timeline Keys\n- Add `Select Nodes by Keys` feature\n\t- Currently this option placed in right-button settings menu\n\t- When option is enabled, on selection timeline keys all relative nodes will be selected\n\t- It raise the comfort with nodes while operating only with timeline keys\n- Timeline Panel UI/UX Improvements\n\t- All selected nodes and properties will be highlighted\n- Add `Panthera Editor Settings` per Defold Project\n\t- You able to create a custom editor settings which will be applied to all animations in this project\n\t- Create a `panthera_editor_config.json` file in the project root to customize the editor settings\n\t- You can set another path in `game.project` file in `panthera.panthera_editor_config` field\n- Update for new Defold\n- Font Size can be changed at runtime without reloading\n- Various Fixes in Defold collections exports\n- Fixes with atlas with luminance image type\n\n`panthera_editor_config.json` example:\n```json\n{\n\t\"timeline_key_numbers\": false,\n\t\"custom_event_ids\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"event_id\": \"my_event\",\n\t\t\t\"default_data\": \"icon_id\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"event_id\": \"my_event_2\",\n\t\t\t\"default_data\": \"username\"\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\t\"timeline_colors\": {\n\t\t\"position_x\": \"#EB6262\",\n\t\t\"position_y\": \"#55CC6F\",\n\t\t\"position_z\": \"#80C0E3\"\n\t},\n\t\"font_size\": 40\n}\n```\n\n\n## Changelog Runtime\n\n- Add support for `Shadow` and `Outline` properties for text labels\n- You can use a hashed animation id: `hash(\"animation_id\")` to specify the animation.\n\t- Useful if you want to specify the animation from the script properties (via `go.property`).\n- The `panthera.set_time` now trigger Events in forward time change\n\t- Not triggered in reverse time change\n- Additional checks for deleted nodes in the animation playback\n\t- Only for game objects\n- Add global Panthera speed modifier (`panthera.SPEED`)\n\t- Now you can adjust speed with three modifiers\n\t\t- global (`panthera.SPEED`)\n\t\t- state (`animation_state.speed`)\n\t\t- instance animation (`animation.speed`)\n- Refactor the animation playback system, should be more performant\n- Fix for `is_editor_only` key field",

Usefull to track clipping nodes\n\t- Add linked icon if project is linked to external file\n\t- Add hotkey `U` to reset changes on selected nodes\n\t- Don't show \"Create Node\" options if project are linked. Linked layout can't be changed\n\t- Add current selected node name node selection gizmo\n\t- Arrow keys to control nodes now respect the Gizmo Step settings\n\t- Add notifiction when you try to change linked file.\n\t- Add notification if `game.project` file is not found for linked file\n\t- Add \"Copy Relative Path\" option at project tab. This path is used in Panthera Runtime\n\n- Fix UI/UX issues:\n\t- Fix #2: \"Node Delete\" option now works properly\n\t- Fix #5: move only parent nodes in group of selected nodes\n\t- Fix #9: Hotkeys should be handled a little bit better\n\t- Editor View will keep position while moving between layout and animation modes\n\t- Fix vector4 property issue when changed properties not highlighted well\n\t- Right click menu for nodes now works properly for selected nodes\n\t- Fix issue when you can still can control animation keys with arrows with no selected nodes\n\t- Fix issue with buttons \"Commit Changes\" and \"Reset Changes\" beign unclickable in some cases\n\t- Fix animation state is not immediately updated after changing timeline keys in timeline key properties panel\n\nKnown issues:\n\t- [Windows] Cyrillic characters in the path to the project can cause the project to not load properly\n\t- Animations from atlases is not imported properly",
