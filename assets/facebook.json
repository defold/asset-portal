Should be called before `facebook.login_with_tracking_preference()`.\n   - `facebook.LOGIN_TRACKING_ENABLED` - available only if in App Tracking Transparency request user enabled tracking.\n   - `facebook.LOGIN_TRACKING_LIMITED` - should beused if in App Tracking Transparency request user disabled tracking.\n\nIf the user has disabled tracking but you still attempt to log in using `facebook.login_with_permissions()` or its equivalent `facebook.login_with_tracking_preference()` with `facebook.LOGIN_TRACKING_ENABLED`, you will receive a Facebook Access token.\n\nre information about the changes is available in the official Facebook documentation:\n * [Changes made to Facebook Login SDK for iOS](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2024/03/28/changes-made-to-fb-login-sdk/)\n * [Limited Login for iOS](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/limited-login/ios)",
