      "message": "This release introduces the Event System, enabling logic and audio control to be separated. And script based queues. This is a breaking release since the create parameters for queues have changed.\n\n## Events and handlers\n\nUse event.trigger(hash) to fire off events which zero or multiple _event handlers_ can react on.\n\n## Queues\n\nTwo new scripts, _random_ and _sequence_ now make it possible to create global queues without writing a single line of code. Used together with the event system this enables sound-designers to fully configure the audio experience without the friction of requesting changes from developers.\n\n**breaking changes**\n- Queue id's are now expected to be hashes.\n- config parameter min_offset changed name to random_offset for clarity.",
